# 3D-Representation-of-Objects-from-Image
Provide 3d coordinate to objects using deep learning model (YOLOv-3) and customized algorithm in openCV.
For object detection it uses YOLOv-3 model and for a dual camera setup. Primary camera provides the coordinates and secondary camera helps primary camera by providing view angle.
